## Molecular Biology of Retinal Degenerations
### Our Mission
At Ueffing Lab, we focus on understanding the disease mechanisms behind Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Inherited Retinal Degenerations (RD), and Ciliopathies. Utilizing medical proteomics, advanced bioanalytical techniques, and high-resolution imaging, we analyze protein complexes, cellular signaling pathways, and disease-associated protein networks. Our lab develops novel iPSC-based co-culture models to study retinal degeneration mechanisms and potential therapies, aiming to translate pre-clinical findings into clinical trials.

### Research Highlights
- **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD):** Investigating the complex interplay of genetic predisposition, age, and lifestyle factors contributing to AMD, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.
- **Retinal Degeneration and Therapy Development:** Understanding the root mechanisms of RD and developing new therapies by identifying disease modifiers and protective mechanisms.
- **Ciliopathies:** Studying the malfunction of cilia, which causes a range of disorders including retinal degeneration, to uncover new therapeutic targets.
- **Innovative Techniques for Research and Diagnostics:** Employing advanced diagnostics like -omics, bioinformatics, and imaging to develop new tools for retinal disease investigation and diagnosis.
